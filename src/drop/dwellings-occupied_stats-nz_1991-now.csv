"The household estimates have as a base the estimated households (in private occupied dwellings) at 30 June 1991, 1996, 2001, 2006, and 2013."
"Each base has been derived indirectly from the estimated resident population and the estimated living arrangement type rates for each age-sex group."
"The estimated number of households at 30 June of the census year is equivalent to the census household count with adjustments for households temporarily absent within New Zealand,"
"net census undercount, households temporarily overseas on census night, and change between census night and 30 June of the respective census year."
"Estimates of household by tenure are derived by applying tenure proportions to the household estimates."
"The tenure proportions are based on census information on tenure of households in private occupied dwellings (excluding visitor-only dwellings)."
"The intercensal tenure proportions are calculated by linearly interpolating between the census tenure proportions."
"From the March 2018 quarter, the tenure proportions applied to the household estimate are held constant at the 2018 Census tenure proportions"
"The tenure 'owner-occupied' includes dwellings owned by individuals or held in a family trust (from 2006)."
"The tenure 'provided free' includes dwellings provided free to households by individuals, private trusts, businesses, and government agencies."
"Interim revision. The tenure estimates have been revised based on tenure proportions from the 2018 Census. However, the household estimates from 2013 are still based on the estimated households at 30 June 2013."
"The final revision of the household estimates will be released once the estimated households 2018-base is available."
